# Changelog

All notable changes to **polars-cv** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-13

### Added

- **`preserve_dtype` on intensity ops** — `scale`, `clamp`, and
  `adjust_brightness` accept `preserve_dtype=True` to cast the `f32` result back
  to the input dtype (e.g. `u8` in → `u8` out) instead of promoting to `f32`.
  Requires a known input dtype and is mutually exclusive with `out_dtype`.
- **Graph-level error policy** — `Pipeline.on_error("raise" | "null" |
  "null_with_message")` (mirrored on `LazyPipelineExpr`). Failing rows null all
  outputs, optionally attaching a reserved `_error` message field, instead of
  failing the whole batch.
- **Full `LazyPipelineExpr` method parity** — every chainable `Pipeline`
  operation can now be called directly on the lazy expression returned by
  `.cv.pipe(...)`, without wrapping each step in its own `Pipeline`. Guarded by
  `test_lazy_pipeline_method_parity`.
- **Shape references for rasterization** — `rasterize(shape=<expr>)` and
  `source("contour", shape=<expr>)` size the raster canvas from a referenced
  pipeline's output `[H, W]`, implemented end-to-end.
- **Rotation parameters** — `rotate()` accepts `interpolation` and
  `border_value`.

### Changed

- **Single schema authority in view-buffer** — the Python planner no longer
  keeps a parallel contract table. Per-op output domain, dtype, rank, and
  channel count are read from view-buffer's declarative rules
  (`OutputChannelRule` / `OutputRankRule`). The `OPERATION_CONTRACTS`,
  `AlphaMode`, and `NdimEffect` structures were removed.
- **Plan == exec** — planned dtype/shape now matches execution for promoting
  binary ops (e.g. true division → `f32`) and for explicitly-typed 16-bit image
  sources.
- **Rotation unified through the affine path** — arbitrary-angle `rotate()`
  routes through `ComputeOp::RotateAffine` → `apply_affine_warp()`; zero-copy
  90/180/270 fast paths are preserved.
- **Portable CI / wheel builds** — abi3 wheels on Linux and a fixed macOS build.

### Fixed

- `cloud_options` now round-trips for remote `file_path` sources.
- Assorted `ruff` / `clippy` lint findings; CI excludes flaky network-marked
  tests.

### Performance

- Kernel fusion extended: casts fold into the `FusedKernel`
  (`u8 → cast(f32) → scale → clamp → relu` runs as one pass); `rotate` →
  `warp_affine` chains fuse.
- Vectorized `erode`/`dilate`, `convolve2d` (interior/border split), and
  separable Gaussian blur; Canny rewritten without `atan2` (bit-exact).
- Remote `file_path` sources prefetch concurrently per batch.
- Graphs compile once into a process-wide cache (`graph/compiled.rs`), so repeat
  invocations (e.g. per streaming morsel) pay only a hash lookup.
